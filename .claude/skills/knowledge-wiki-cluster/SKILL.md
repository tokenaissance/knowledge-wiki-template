# Knowledge Wiki Cluster

Detect clusters of concepts that share a non-existing implied parent slug, create a parent topic overview, then decide for each child whether to **fold** (merge content into parent and delete the child) or **skip** (keep the child as a standalone concept linked to the parent). The goal is to reduce total concept count by absorbing thin, redundant, or retired sub-concepts into a parent article.

Each concept is grouped under its non-existing prefix ancestors up to (but not including) its nearest existing ancestor — so `apple-watch-ultra` still forms an `[apple-watch]` cluster even when `apple.md` exists. Presents one cluster at a time with a batch fold/skip recommendation — you confirm, override, or dismiss.

## Steps

### 1. Establish the working directory

The knowledge base root is the Git repository root. Run `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` and store the result as `KNOWLEDGE_PATH`.

### 2. Find clusters

Run:

```bash
node {KNOWLEDGE_PATH}/scripts/wiki/wiki-lint.mjs missing-parent-clusters
```

This outputs `{ "clusters": [...] }` sorted **deepest first** (most hyphens in `impliedParent`), with ties broken by cluster size descending. Each entry has `impliedParent` (the slug that doesn't exist yet) and `children` (array of concept file paths, e.g. `Wiki/Concepts/audi-etron.md`). Previously dismissed clusters are already filtered out.

Derive each child's slug from its filename: `Wiki/Concepts/audi-etron.md` → `audi-etron`. Use this slug wherever `{child-slug}` appears below.

If the `clusters` array is empty, print `No clusters found.` and stop.

### 3. LLM pre-filter

Before presenting clusters to the user, auto-dismiss clusters where the implied parent is a common English modifier rather than a meaningful proper noun or specific topic — e.g. `smart` grouping `smart-home` with `smart-money`, or `the` grouping `the-economist` with `the-expanse`. Children spanning clearly unrelated domains are a reliable signal for auto-dismissal.

For each auto-dismissed cluster:

```bash
node {KNOWLEDGE_PATH}/scripts/wiki/wiki-state.mjs dismiss-cluster-parent "{impliedParent}"
```

Be conservative — a wrongly dismissed cluster requires manually editing `Wiki/.state.json` to recover.

### 4. Present and resolve each cluster

Process one cluster at a time. Use a **separate interaction for each cluster** — never combine multiple clusters into a single question.

Maintain an **in-memory processed set** of `impliedParent` slugs handled in this session. After creating a parent, exclude already-processed slugs from the refreshed cluster list.

---

#### 4a. Read, summarize, and assess

Read every child concept file. Present a cluster summary as a 3-column table with each child's description and fold/skip recommendation inline. Output the table as markdown (not in a code block) so it renders:

---
**Cluster: [{impliedParent}]  ({N} children)**

| Child | Description | Recommendation |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| `{child-slug}` | {one-sentence description} | **Fold** — {reason} |
| `{child-slug}` | {one-sentence description} | **Skip** — {reason} |

---

Derive a human-readable **Display Name** for the implied parent (e.g. `audi` → `Audi`, `apple-watch` → `Apple Watch`, `career` → `Career`).

Then write 1–2 sentences of reasoning: what the children have in common and whether creating a parent would add meaningful value.

Use these criteria — **Fold** for thin, narrow, or low-standalone-value concepts; **Skip** for substantive articles with rich prose, multiple sources, or broad cross-links.

#### 4b. Ask what to do

**If `AskUserQuestion` is available**, ask with these options. Add `(Recommended)` to Proceed only when the cluster is a clear brand, product line, or named topic with 3+ children that obviously belong under it **and** at least one child is recommended for folding. If all children are Skip, the parent is still worth creating as an overview but is not strongly recommended. **Never** put `(Recommended)` on Dismiss.

| # | Option | Description |
|---|--------|-------------|
| 1 | `Proceed` | Create "{Display Name}" and apply the fold/skip recommendations above |
| 2 | `Skip all` | Create "{Display Name}" but keep all children standalone |
| 3 | `Fold all` | Create "{Display Name}" and fold every child into it |
| 4 | `Dismiss` | These don't belong together; never show this cluster again |

Users may also type `skip` (leave for now; show again next run), `review one by one` (create parent then decide each child individually), or `stop` (halt all remaining clusters) in the Other field.

**If `AskUserQuestion` is unavailable**, print as a numbered list; also accept `skip`, `review one by one`, or `stop`.

---

#### 4c. If Proceed, Skip all, Fold all, or Review one by one was selected

Record decisions in memory based on the selection:
- **Proceed**: fold the children listed under Recommend Fold; skip the rest
- **Skip all**: skip every child
- **Fold all**: fold every child
- **Review one by one**: ask about each child individually (see below), then proceed

Do not create or edit any files until all decisions are collected. If `stop` was entered at any point, proceed to section 4f without creating any files.

**Review one by one:** Process one child at a time. Present your recommendation and reasoning for that child, then ask:

**If `AskUserQuestion` is available**, ask with these options (add `(Recommended)` to whichever applies):

| # | Option | Description |
|---|--------|-------------|
| 1 | `Fold "{child-display-name}" into "{Display Name}"` | Merge child's content into parent, then delete child |
| 2 | `Skip "{child-display-name}"` | Keep child standalone; will be linked to parent |

**If `AskUserQuestion` is unavailable**, print as a numbered list. Accept: `1` (Fold), `2` (Skip), `done` (proceed with decisions collected so far — unprocessed children will be treated as Skip), or `stop`.

If `stop` was entered, proceed to section 4f without creating any files.

**After collecting all decisions, create and populate the parent concept:**

```bash
node {KNOWLEDGE_PATH}/scripts/wiki/wiki-concept.mjs create "{impliedParent}" "{Display Name}"
```

This creates `Wiki/Concepts/{impliedParent}.md`.

**Write the initial parent article body:**

Read the file, then insert a 1–3 paragraph topic overview between `# {Display Name}` and `## Sources`. Write it as a factual reference — what this topic is and what sub-concepts exist under it. Keep it concise; each Fold will enrich the body incrementally. Use American English spelling. Update the existing `tags: []` field with the union of tags from the child files, keeping only those that genuinely describe the parent topic.

**Update the index:**

```bash
node {KNOWLEDGE_PATH}/scripts/wiki/wiki-index.mjs upsert-concept "{impliedParent}" "{Display Name}" "{one-line English description}"
```

**Link all children bidirectionally (idempotent):**

For each child, derive its display name from its H1 heading (`# …`). Run both commands — the first adds the child to the parent's Connected Concepts, the second adds the parent to the child's:

```bash
node {KNOWLEDGE_PATH}/scripts/wiki/wiki-concept.mjs insert-connected-concept "{impliedParent}" "{child-slug}" "{child-display-name}"
node {KNOWLEDGE_PATH}/scripts/wiki/wiki-concept.mjs insert-connected-concept "{child-slug}" "{impliedParent}" "{Display Name}"
```

Run this for every child regardless of fold/skip decision.

**Execute folds:**

For each child where Fold was chosen, execute the `knowledge-wiki-merge` step 3c with this mapping:
- **primary** = parent: slug `{impliedParent}`, display name `{Display Name}`, path `Wiki/Concepts/{impliedParent}.md`
- **secondary** = child: slug `{child-slug}`, display name `{child-display-name}`, path `Wiki/Concepts/{child-slug}.md`

**Wrap up:**

This runs whether or not all children were processed. Add `{impliedParent}` to the in-memory processed set. Re-run:

```bash
node {KNOWLEDGE_PATH}/scripts/wiki/wiki-lint.mjs missing-parent-clusters
```

Replace your working cluster list with this fresh output, excluding any slug already in the processed set.

---

#### 4d. If Dismiss or "skip" was selected

If Dismiss: run `node {KNOWLEDGE_PATH}/scripts/wiki/wiki-state.mjs dismiss-cluster-parent "{impliedParent}"`.

Add `{impliedParent}` to the processed set and continue. (No refresh needed — no concept files were created.)

#### 4f. If "stop"

Exit the loop and proceed to step 5.

---

### 5. Print summary
